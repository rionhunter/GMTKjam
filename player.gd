# The player and the character are documented as two different entities

# determine: the player must make a choice (through text) and can't change subject
# dialogue: The player's text is being ported directly through the mouth of the character

### Queue
# Each time a new item is added, as well as at random, semi-frequent intervals, the character will assess the
# value and priority of each entry, and sort accordingly. Additional weight is made towards an act that the player
# has insisted on, but bad circumstances (such as weather, health) can still deter the character enough
# to avoid doing it.

# Keeping track of flavor text to print to screen when
